## 🎯 Key Achievements & Learning Outcomes

This internship provided a structured progression through critical cybersecurity domains:

* **Week 1-2: Foundation & Remediation 🛠️**
    * Conducted initial **vulnerability assessments** using **OWASP ZAP**.
    * Implemented **secure coding practices** to fix fundamental flaws like basic authentication issues, insecure direct object references (IDOR), and improper error handling.

* **Week 3-4: Advanced Defenses & API Security 🌐**
    * Enhanced **penetration testing** skills to identify complex vulnerabilities.
    * Established **logging and monitoring** for threat detection.
    * Secured **API endpoints** with **rate limiting** and proper **CORS** configurations.
    * Implemented robust **HTTP security headers** including HSTS and a comprehensive Content Security Policy (CSP).

* **Week 5-6: Exploitation, Mitigation & Deployment Readiness 🚀**
    * Gained hands-on experience exploiting **SQL Injection** and **CSRF** using **SQLMap** and **Burp Suite**, then implemented **prepared statements** and **CSRF tokens** for mitigation.
    * Performed **advanced security audits** (ZAP, Nikto, Lynis) and ensured **OWASP Top 10 compliance**.
    * Applied **secure deployment practices**, including **dependency scanning** and **Docker container hardening**.
